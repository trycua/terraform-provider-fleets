# Cyclops Go UniFFI bindings

Generated with `uniffi-bindgen-go v0.7.1+v0.31.0`. This checked-in snapshot is
outside `scripts/generate-sdk-bindings.sh`; it currently exposes direct record
constructors, not the newer `UniffiBuilder` objects present in Rust metadata.
Regenerating and validating this separate pipeline is required before builders
can be advertised for Go. Build consumers with the Cyclops Rust cdylib
available to cgo, for example:

`CGO_LDFLAGS='-L/path/to -lcyclops_sdk' LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to go test ./...`
